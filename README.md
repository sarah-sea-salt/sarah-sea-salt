Howdy! My name is Sarah Amiri - @sarah-sea-salt
I’m interested in marine microbial driven interactions with the Marine Boundary Layer in the regional to global ocean.
Interests: Probabilistic programming in python & the upcoming NASA PACE satellite's biggest fan.
Collaborations: I’m looking to collaborate on open source ocean to atmosphere projects that include field measurements & spatial/satellite repositories. If you have a project in mind, let's chat!
