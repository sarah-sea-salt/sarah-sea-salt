Howdy! My name is Sarah Amiri, and I’m interested probabilistic programming + deep generative modelling projects centered on how the living ocean is linked the the atmosphere. I’m looking to collaborate on open source ocean-to-atmosphere projects that include field measurements & spatial/satellite repositories. If you have a project in mind, let's chat!
